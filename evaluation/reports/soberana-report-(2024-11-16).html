This is because the vaccine&#x27;s effects may still be occurring, and the trial aims to assess the safety and efficacy of a new treatment or intervention.\\n\\n## Step 4: Clarify the purpose of exclusion\\nThe purpose of excluding individuals who received a COVID-19 vaccine within the last 30 days is to ensure that the trial results accurately reflect the effects of the new treatment or intervention, without any potential bias from the vaccine&#x27;s effects.\\n\\nThe final answer is: Unfortunately, the context does not provide enough information to give a specific answer to this question.","## Answer\\n### Calculating Vaccine Efficacy Time Frame\\n\\nThe time frame used to calculate vaccine efficacy is defined as the period from:\\n- **14 days after the second dose (two doses analysis)**\\n- **42 days after the second dose (three doses analysis)**\\n\\nThis time frame is crucial in determining the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease.

The primary purpose of a dictionary is to provide definitions, etymologies, and usage guidelines for words in a language. Dictionaries can be used for various purposes, including:\\n\\n* **Language learning**: Dictionaries help learners understand the meanings, pronunciation, and usage of words in a new language.\\n* **Communication**: Dictionaries enable users to look up the meanings of unfamiliar words, ensuring accurate and clear communication.\\n* **Research**: Dictionaries are essential tools for researchers, providing access to etymologies, synonyms, and antonyms.\\n* **Language documentation**: Dictionaries help document languages, preserving their vocabulary and syntax.\\n\\nIn the context of the COVID-19 vaccine study, a dictionary might be used to understand the terminology and jargon used in the research, ensuring that participants and researchers communicate effectively.","## Answer\\n### Duration of Solicited Systemic AEs after the Third Dose\\n\\nThe median duration of solicited systemic AEs (adverse events) after the third dose is 2 days, with a range of 0-7.5 days.","## User&#x27;s Query\\nWhat percentage of local adverse events were grade 3?\\n\\n## Answer\\nLocal adverse events were grade 3 in less than 0.2% of cases.","## Answer\\nNo data is provided on the percentage of participants who withdrew their consent after receiving both doses of the treatment.","## Answer\\nThe type of vaccine being discussed in the context of COVID-19 is a subunit conjugate vaccine, specifically SOBERANA-02.","## Answer\\n### SOBERANA 02 Vaccine\\n\\nThe vaccine being studied in a phase 2b clinical trial at the Finlay Vaccine Institute in Havana, Cuba is called SOBERANA 02.","## Answer\\n### Vaccination Effectiveness\\n\\nA 3-dose vaccination schedule with SOBERANA-02 and SOBERANA-Plus resulted in a vaccine efficacy of 92.0% (95% CI: 80.4\\u201396.7%) for prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among the study subjects.","## Answer\\n### Confirmation of COVID-19 through RT-PCR\\n\\nThe confirmation of COVID-19 through RT-PCR is performed by the SARS CoV-2 national reference laboratory at the \\u201cPedro Kour\\u00ed\\u201d Tropical Medical Institute in Havana, Cuba.","## Answer\\n### Medical Conditions for Ineligibility in a Clinical Trial\\n\\nUnfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state the patient ineligibility criteria for the multi-task learning program. However, based on the list of medical conditions mentioned, patients with serious medical conditions such as kidney disease, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cancer, HIV, and immunodeficiency may be excluded from participating in the program.","## Response\\n### Ensuring Data Confidentiality and Quality Control in Clinical Trials\\n\\nTo ensure data confidentiality and monitor the quality of clinical trials, our organization takes the following measures:\\n\\n### Data Confidentiality\\n1.  **Data Encryption**: We use advanced encryption techniques to protect sensitive information both in transit and at rest.\\n2.  **Access Controls**: Only authorized personnel with the necessary clearances can access the data.\\n3.  **Secure Storage**: Data is stored on secure servers with multiple layers of backup and redundancy.\\n\\n### Quality Control and Monitoring\\n1.  **Standardized Procedures**: We adhere to standardized working procedures for data management, which ensures consistency and quality across all trials.\\n2.  **Regular Audits**: Our data management activities are subject to regular audits to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies.\\n3.  **Monitoring and Reporting**: We establish monitoring plans to detect and correct any discrepancies or issues that may arise during the conduct of clinical trials.\\n\\nBy implementing these measures, we can ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data, as well as maintain the high quality of our clinical trials.","## Answer\\nThe efficacy for the So2P regimen was estimated to be at least 60% compared to the placebo group."]],["reference_answer",["92.0% (95%CI 80.4\\u201396.7)","0.3% of participants","The vaccine efficacy for prevention of severe COVID-19 was 74.9% (95%CI: 33.7\\u201390.5)","92.0% (95%CI 80.4\\u201396.7)","Current or planned receipt of immunomodulatory drugs","The VE for So2P was estimated considering the So2P and control arm cases occurring in the same calendar period (14 days after dose 3 in So2P and 42 days after the 2nd dose in placebo).","Proposals for full data sharing should be sent to mariaeugenia@ipk.sld.cu, vicente.verez@finlay.edu.cu or ci\\ufb01nlay@finlay.edu.cu.","They are easier to distribute and use than those vaccines that must be stored at much lower temperatures and require powerful freezers.","The trial was supervised and monitored by MRG, BPM, IMH, and the manuscript was written by METR, CVS, WBR, DGR, YVB, VVB, and PVdS.","The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 is used for assessing the causality of adverse events following immunisation.","2 days after the third dose (25\\u201375th percentile: 0.8\\u20137.5)","less than 0.2%","0.38%","The vaccine being discussed is a COVID-19 vaccine, specifically a RBD-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine","FINLAY-FR-1A vaccine","80.4\\u201396.7%","The SARS CoV-2 national reference laboratory at the \\u201cPedro Kour\\u00ed\\u201d Tropical Medical Institute, Havana, Cuba.","kidney disease, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma (grade 2/3), cancer, HIV or primary/secondary immunodeficiency.","A unique code assigned to each subject at enrolment guarantees confidentiality, while site visits verify adherence to the study protocol, good clinical practise, and standard operating procedures.","92.0%"]],["id",[6,38,49,6,23,35,69,66,67,75,48,41,40,71,74,51,28,45,32,52]],["content",["Findings We included 44,031 participants (52.0% female, 48.0% male; median age 50 years, range 19\\u201380 years; 7.0%\\nblack, 24.0% mixed-race, 59.0% white) in a context of initial Beta VOC predominance, with this variant being partially\\nreplaced by Delta near the trial\\u2019s end.
