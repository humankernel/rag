On each of these projected versions of\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"situational","seed_document_id":14,"situational_context":"The researcher is scrutinizing the performance of attention mechanisms in a deep neural network, specifically seeking to understand why the dot product attention fails for larger input sizes.","topic":"Others"}}
