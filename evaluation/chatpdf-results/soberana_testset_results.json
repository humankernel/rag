It was conducted in a context of initial predominance of Beta VOC, with this variant being partially replaced by Delta towards the end of the observation period. The vaccine efficacy (VE) of the two doses scheme was 69.7% (95%CI 56.5–78.9) 14 days after the second dose administration. VE for the heterologous three-dose combination was 92.0% (95%CI 80.4–96.7). Severe COVID-19 occurred in 23 and 5 participants in the placebo and SOBERANA-02 group (VE 74.9%; 95%CI: 33.7–90.5) and led to 3 and 2 deaths, respectively. Fourteen days after the third dose, severe disease occurred in 6 and 0 placebo and SOBERANA-Plus group participants, respectively; no death was observed in any of the groups. The occurrence of serious and severe AEs was infrequent and similarly distributed between the placebo and vaccine groups. Solicited AEs were slightly more frequent in the vaccine group but predominantly local and mostly mild and transient. Implications of all the available evidence SOBERANA-02, the first protein based conjugate vaccine against SARS CoV-2, and SOBERANA-Plus are straightforward to manufacture and have logistical advantages in terms of storage and distribution, due to being stable and permitting the use of a conventional 2–8 ◦C cold-chain. The vaccines are efficacious in a context of Beta and Delta VOC circulation, have a favourable safety profile, and constitute an attractive, feasible option for resource constrained low- and middle- income setting"

All-cause mortality was 24 (0.2%) amongst placebo recipients against 9 and 11 (0.1%) in groups So2 and So2P (P = 0.014). No death was vaccine related.

Recruitment of participants through family medicine practices, which guaranteed accelerated inclusion reflecting the composition of the population in terms of gender, race and pre-existing conditions, constitutes a strength of this study. Coordination with the health system’s established and well adhered to routine SARS- CoV-2/COVID-19 activities for case ascertainment, hospitalization and standardised case management also contribute to the strengths. Recombinant protein COVID-19 vaccines are stable and can be stocked at 2◦ to 8 ◦C in a regular refrigerator and are easier to distribute and use than those vaccines that must be stored at much lower temperatures and require powerful freezers. This represents a key advan- tage in less-wealthy countries. Furthermore, they rely on an established and widely used vaccine technology, and their production can be cost-effectively implemented and scaled up in biotechnology facilities in the global south that are manufacturing other protein subunit products. Overall, our results indicate that the SOBER- ANA vaccines are efficacious in a context of Beta and Delta VOC circulation, have a favourable safety profile, and constitute an attractive, feasible option for use in COVID-19 vaccination.

            "Immunisation with an effective vaccine constitutes the main tool to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and achieving high vaccination coverage is critical to control the emergence and spread of new SARS CoV-2 vari- ants.1 Clinical trials provided evidences of the efficacy of vaccines based on different technologies, which received WHO endorsed emergency use authorisation. 2 Notwithstanding, even under optimistic manufacturing and delivery scenarios, global equitable access to vac- cines is likely to be limited when relying on the currently available products only.3 SOBERANA-02 is a subunit conjugated protein-based COVID-19 vaccine. The antigen is the recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) protein conjugated chemically to tetanus toxoid (TT).4 The well-known pro- tein-polysaccharide conjugation technology provided novel, safe and highly immunogenic paediatric vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b from the 1980s onwards,     5 and for protecting against Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae,     6,     7 among others. In phase 1 and 2a clinical trials two doses of SOBERANA-02 induced neutralising antibodies and T- cells with IFNγ secretion, indicative of a Th1 response pattern.8 A single dose of SOBERANA-Plus (RBD- dimer/Alum) demonstrated booster capacity in conva- lescent COVID-19 patients who had acquired natural immunity against the virus,     9 through hybrid immu- nity.10 A third heterologous dose of SOBERANA-Plus after two doses of SOBERANA-02 significantly increased neutralising anti-RBD IgG titres. 8 These re- sults were confirmed in a phase 2b clinical trial.1"

            "Added value of this study We report on a multicentre, phase 3 randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial conducted in Havana, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. The trial included three groups receiving 28 days apart either two doses of SOBERANA-02, or a heterologous scheme with a dose of SOBERANA-Plus added to it, or placebo. It was conducted in a context of initial predominance of Beta VOC, with this variant being partially replaced by Delta towards the end of the observation period. The vaccine efficacy (VE) of the two doses scheme was 69.7% (95%CI 56.5–78.9) 14 days after the second dose administration. VE for the heterologous three-dose combination was 92.0% (95%CI 80.4–96.7). Severe COVID-19 occurred in 23 and 5 participants in the placebo and SOBERANA-02 group (VE 74.9%; 95%CI: 33.7–90.5) and led to 3 and 2 deaths, respectively. Fourteen days after the third dose, severe disease occurred in 6 and 0 placebo and SOBERANA-Plus group participants, respectively; no death was observed in any of the groups. The occurrence of serious and severe AEs was infrequent and similarly distributed between the placebo and vaccine groups. Solicited AEs were slightly more frequent in the vaccine group but predominantly local and mostly mild and transient. Implications of all the available evidence SOBERANA-02, the first protein based conjugate vaccine against SARS CoV-2, and SOBERANA-Plus are straightforward to manufacture and have logistical advantages in terms of storage and distribution, due to being stable and permitting the use of a conventional 2–8 ◦C cold-chain. The vaccines are efficacious in a context of Beta and Delta VOC circulation, have a favourable safety profile, and constitute an attractive, feasible option for resource constrained low- and middle- income settings",
            "Efficacy The final analysis of the two-doses schedule included 174 cases of symptomatic COVID-19: 136 in the placebo group (99.9 per 1000 person-years; 95%CI 83.8–118.2) and 38 in the So2 group (30.5 per 1000 person-years; 95%CI 21.6–41.9). This corresponds to 69.7% VE (95% CI 56.5–78.9%; P < 0.001) for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection by the So2 schedule (Table 2, Fig. 3, S13-Fig. S2). The vaccine efficacy to prevent COVID-19 was congruous across subgroups stratified by demographic and baseline characteristics (S14-Fig. S3). The VE for prevention of severe COVID-19 (23 cases in placebo vs 5 in So2) was 74.9% (95%CI: 33.7–90.5) (S12-Table S10). There were 3 and 2 deaths from COVID-19 disease, respectively; the small number of events precludes a point estimate of VE. For the final analysis of the three-dose heterologous So2P schedule 41 cases of COVID-19 were included: 35 in the placebo group (91.4 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI 63.4–126.6) and 6 in the So2P group, (6.6 per 1000 person-years; 95%CI 2.4–14.5). This means 92.0% VE (95%CI 80.4–96.7%; P < 0.001) for prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection by the 3-dose schedule (Table 2, Fig. 3, S15-Fig. S4). Subgroup’s analysis yields remarkably consistent VE estimates, but lacks precision for much of the strata (S16-Fig. S5). Severe COVID-19 occurred in 6 and 0 participants in the placebo and So2P group, respectively (S12-Table S10). There were no deaths from COVID-19 disease."

The platform registers COVID-19 doses administered in all vaccination centres in Cuba, and results of PCR tests performed in all laboratories of the health system. To digitalise the primary information, we employed data operators who were trained in the use of the soft- ware packages. Both platforms provide an exhaustive change control record, ensuring security and integrity, and allow data export. A unique code assigned to each subject at enrolment guaranteed confidentiality and permitted linking information from both sources. The sponsor’s staff ensured data export and cleansing for the subsequent carrying out the interim and final analyses. All data management activities were governed by standardised working procedures. We developed a monitoring and audit plan for quality control. During site visits, the proper conduct of the trial was verified by assessing adherence to the study protocol, good clinical practise, and standard operating procedures. We systematically checked the completion of all records and the quality of digitalization.
