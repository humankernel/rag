To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9]. In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies: P E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel ) P E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel ) where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of P Epos"

Additionally, the paper discusses how attention mechanisms, including the scaled dot-product attention, have been integrated into various models, including **recurrent neural networks (RNNs)** and **long short-term memory (LSTM)** networks, to enhance their ability to model dependencies in sequences.

        "answer": "The dot products in the attention mechanism can become excessively large when the dimensionality of the keys and queries, denoted as $d_k$, is large. This situation arises because under the assumption that the components of the query $q$ and key $k$ are independent random variables with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1, the variance of their dot product $q \\cdot k$ grows linearly with $d_k$. Specifically, the variance of the dot product is given by:     $     \text{Var         }(q \\cdot k) = d_k     $     As $d_k$ increases, the dot products can take on large values, which pushes the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients. This phenomenon can lead to vanishing gradients, making it difficult for the model to learn effectively during training. To mitigate this effect, the dot products are scaled by a factor of $\frac{             1         }{\\sqrt{d_k             }         }$ before applying the softmax function, which helps to keep the values in a more manageable range and maintains the gradients at a more useful scale.",

In Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting.

This approach is designed to improve model capacity and efficiency.  In the MoE layer: - Each input is routed to a small number of \"expert\" models based on a gating mechanism, which determines which experts to activate for a given input. - This sparsity means that, although the overall model may contain many parameters (from all experts), only a few are used at any one time, which reduces computational costs and memory usage. - The gating mechanism typically uses a softmax function to assign probabilities to each expert, allowing the model to learn which experts are most relevant for different types of inputs. This architecture enables the model to scale effectively, leveraging the strengths of multiple experts while maintaining efficiency, making it particularly useful in tasks like neural machine translation where diverse linguistic patterns may be present [T5     ].",

The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively. 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position- wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [         11     ] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [         1     ]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512. Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i. 3.2 Attention An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [         9     ].

        "question": "How does the use of attention mechanisms in the proposed Transformer model differ from dot-product attention, especially for large values of sequence length?",
        "answer": "In the proposed Transformer model, the attention mechanism is specifically designed as \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention.\" The key difference from standard dot-product attention, particularly for large values of sequence length, lies in the scaling factor applied to the dot products. 1. **Scaling Factor**: In the Transformer model, the dot products of the queries and keys are divided by $ \\sqrt{d_k} $ (where $ d_k $ is the dimension of the keys). This scaling is crucial because, for large values of $ d_k $, the dot products can grow large in magnitude, which can push the softmax function into regions where it has very small gradients. By scaling down the dot products, the model mitigates this issue, allowing for more stable gradients during training [T6]. 2. **Computational Efficiency**: The Transformer model's attention mechanism is implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication, making it more efficient in practice compared to naive implementations of dot-product attention. This efficiency is particularly beneficial when dealing with long sequences, as it allows the model to handle larger inputs without a significant increase in computational cost [T6]. 3. **Parallelization**: The attention mechanism in the Transformer allows for the computation of attention scores for all positions in parallel, which is a significant advantage over recurrent models. This parallelization is especially effective for long sequences, as it reduces the time complexity associated with sequential processing [T2]. Overall, the use of scaled dot-product attention in the Transformer model enhances the model's ability to learn from long sequences by addressing the issues of gradient stability and computational efficiency.",

Motivating our use of self-attention weconsider three desiderata.One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that canbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-rangedependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting theability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have totraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the inputand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [                12            ]. Hence we also comparethe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of thedifferent layer types.As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentiallyexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

        "question": "As I'm trying to optimize the performance of my deep neural network with larger input sizes, I've noticed that the dot products in the attention mechanism are getting extremely large for bigger values of d_k. Can you help me understand why this is happening?",
        "answer": "The issue of extremely large dot products in the attention mechanism, particularly for larger values of $ d_k $ (the dimension of the keys), arises from the statistical properties of the dot product of random vectors.    1. **Dot Product Growth**: When you compute the dot product of two independent random vectors $ q $ and $ k $, each with components that are independent random variables (assuming they have mean 0 and variance 1), the dot product can be expressed as:       $       q \\cdot k = \\sum_{i=1        }^{d_k        } q_i k_i       $       The variance of this dot product is $ d_k $. This means that as $ d_k $ increases, the expected magnitude of the dot product also increases, leading to larger values.        2. **Magnitude of Components**: For large dimensions, the components of the vectors $ q $ and $ k $ can take on larger values due to the central limit theorem, which suggests that the sum of a large number of independent random variables tends to be normally distributed with a mean that grows with the number of variables. Consequently, the dot product can become very large, which can push the softmax function into regions where it has very small gradients.        3. **Softmax Saturation**: When the dot products are large, the softmax function, which is used to compute the attention weights, can become saturated. This means that the output probabilities can become very close to 0 or 1, leading to a loss of information and making it difficult for the model to learn effectively. The gradients during backpropagation can also become very small, hindering the training process.        To mitigate this issue, the Transformer model employs a scaling factor of $ \frac{            1        }{\\sqrt{d_k            }        } $ in the attention mechanism. This scaling helps to keep the dot products within a more manageable range, ensuring that the softmax function operates in a region where it can produce meaningful gradients for learning [T6        ].",

Each position in the sequence has a corresponding vector of this dimension. 2. Structure of the FFN: The FFN consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between. The mathematical representation is as follows: FFN(x)=max(0,xW1​+b1​)W2​+b2​ - Here, W1​ and W2​ are weight matrices for the two linear transformations. - b1​ and b2​ are the corresponding bias vectors. 3. Output Dimension: - The first linear transformation (with weight matrix W1​) expands the input dimension from dmodel​ to dff​ (the inner-layer dimension), which is typically larger (e.g., 2048). - The second linear transformation (with weight matrix W2​) reduces the dimension back to dmodel​. 4. Example: If dmodel​=512 and dff​=2048: - The first transformation takes an input vector of size 512 and produces an output vector of size 2048. - After applying the ReLU activation, the second transformation takes the 2048-dimensional output and reduces it back to 512 dimensions.

We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2. 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically.

Here's how the input and output dimensions of the linear transformations in the FFN work: 1. Input Dimension: The input to the FFN comes from the output of the attention layer, which has a dimension of dmodel​. This dimension is consistent throughout the model, meaning that the output from the attention mechanism (whether it's from the encoder or decoder) will have the same dimension as the input to the FFN. 2. Structure of the FFN: The FFN typically consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between. The structure can be described as follows: - The first linear transformation projects the input from dmodel​ to a higher-dimensional space, often denoted as dff​ (the dimension of the feed-forward layer). This is usually larger than dmodel​ to allow for more complex representations. - The second linear transformation projects the output back from dff​ to dmodel​. Mathematically, this can be represented as: FFN(x)=ReLU(xW1​+b1​)W2​+b2​ where: - x is the input with dimension dmodel​. - W1​ is the weight matrix for the first linear transformation with dimensions dmodel​×dff​. - b1​ is the bias vector for the first layer with dimension dff​. - W2​ is the weight matrix for the second linear transformation with dimensions dff​×dmodel​. - b2​ is the bias vector for the second layer with dimension dmodel​. 3. Output Dimension: The output of the FFN will have the same dimension as the input, which is dmodel​. This ensures that the output can be seamlessly integrated back into the subsequent layers of the Transformer architecture, maintaining consistency in dimensions throughout the model. In summary, the FFN in a Transformer model takes an input of dimension dmodel​, processes it through two linear transformations (with an activation function in between), and outputs a tensor of the same dimension dmodel​.
